gunicorn
# For URL parsing and analysis
tldextract # To get domain, subdomain, suffix

# cryptography # If you want to parse certs deeply; Playwright offers some basic info
# python-whois # For domain age (requires network access, might be slow/blocked)
# For entropy calculation
scipy # For entropy, or implement a simpler version
# Requests can be useful for out-of-band checks if needed (e.g. checking SSL without Playwright)
requests
beautifulsoup4 # For easier HTML parsing if needed, though Playwright locators are powerful
